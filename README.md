Travelocity.com is an online travel agency owned by Expedia Group. It has 12.4 million unique visitors and 91 million page views, making it the third most popular website owned by Expedia Group, after Expedia.com and Hotels.com.

One of the pioneers of web-based disintermediation, Travelocity.com was the first website that allowed consumers the ability to purchase travel tickets without the help of a person.

In addition to airfares, the site also permits consumers to book hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and packaged vacations.
